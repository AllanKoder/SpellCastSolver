# SpellCast Solver
An application for the Discord Game SpellCast. Spellcast is very similar to Boggle, where you try to find the best word possible

I saw some existing solutions out there and wanted to make a faster and cleaner solution. My application can support up to 4 substitions within a minute.

_blue tile is the start of the word_

_red tile is a tile that needs to be substituted_

**Features:**
- up to 4 substitions
- fast
- clean and easy UI


**Potential Improvements:**
- Using Monte Carlo for determining if shuffle is optimal
- Accounting for gems and optimal gem collection
